            <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
            <p>
                Cloud Computer science involves the utilisation of remote powerful machines rather than
                users relying on local hardware or onsite servers. 
            </p>

                One advantage of cloud computing solutions is that you pay for as much as you need
                if you are a single user you are unlikely to require much processing power, but large 
                companies will require more processing as well as data storage.
            </p>
            <!-- I would reword this: One advantage of cloud computing solutions is that you pay for as much as you need. 
            If you are a single user you are unlikely to require much processing power so avoiding having to pay for a server that is too powerful for your needs
            saves money. -->
            <p>
               Storing in the cloud also means that files can be accessible from any connected device!
